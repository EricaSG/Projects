## Project Task
Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. Your team is charged with doing **data analysis and creating a presentation** that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then **translate those findings into actionable insights** that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.
## Deliverables
* 1 Jupyter Notebook
* README.md
* Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation
* A Blog Post
* Video Walkthrough

## Project Task
At times, the evidence of pneumonia may be in a portion of the lung that is not easily seen by the standard x-ray. The misdiagnosis of pneumonia delays treatment and can results in long term disability or death. **This study aims to prove that if X-ray images are colorized, the rate of misdiagnosis (and complications associated) will decrease.** This project is an expansion of Deep Learning & Pneumonia Detection https://github.com/EricaSG/Mod4Project.
